        I've included certain products and links to those products on this site that I will earn an affiliate commission for any purchases you make.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have an affiliate agreement with several of the products I recommend. Therefore, you should assume that any links leading you to products or services are affiliate links that I will receive compensation from just to be safe.
    </p>

    <p>
        I only promote the products or services I have personally investigated and truly feel deliver value to you. The affiliate commission has no bearing on my decision to recommend a product to you. For example, I recommend Site Ground even though I was rejected from their affiliate program. I do have a referral link in exchange for which I receive free hosting, but I do not receive any affiliate commissions from Site Ground. I could have recommended Blue Host and earned an affiliate commission but I do not because their customer service is not on par.
