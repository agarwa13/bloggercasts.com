                                is protected both online and offline.

                                Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card
                                data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a
                                secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon
                                at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the
                                beginning of the address of the web page.
