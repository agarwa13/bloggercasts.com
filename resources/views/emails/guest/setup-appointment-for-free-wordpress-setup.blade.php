Hi!<br>
<br>
Nikhil here from bloggercasts.com :).<br>
Looks like you would like to use our service to setup your blog. Let me know when is a good time to chat.<br>
The first step is to schedule a phone call / skype call.<br>
I am usually available between 5pm and 10pm PST on weekdays (I live in Seattle, WA).<br>
I am more flexible on the weekends. I am available from 9am to 10pm PST on the weekends.<br>
Please reply to this email with your availability and your preference (skype or phone call)<br>
<br>
During our chat, we will discuss your vision and goals for the site.<br>
Please don't feel like you need to prepare anything. Even if you don't
have a solid idea of what you want your site to be, I will ensure we have a fruitful conversation.<br>
<br>
At the end of our discussion, I hope to be able to put together a proposal for your site.<br>
Once you review the proposal, I will implement and 'connect' everything so it works seamlessly.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to hearing from you.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Nikhil Agarwal<br>
